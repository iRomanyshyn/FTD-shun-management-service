# Development Log

This is the chronological engineering record for material work in this repository. New entries are appended, never silently substituted for earlier decisions. Each entry should include the date, scope, validation, and remaining risk or follow-up.

## 2026-10-13 — Foundation implementation and operational documentation

**Status:** In progress

Implemented the first management-plane increment: the FastAPI Web/BFF and Unix-socket API, SQLite WAL state and audit history, validated static device inventory, semantic removal workflows, CSRF protection, and the fixed binary future-agent protocol. Added Caddy and Authelia deployment assets, local-user authentication with a documented LDAP(S) migration path, and structured development, deployment, and operations manuals.

The design supports multiple FTD devices using one shared FTD service account/key while retaining per-device IDs, display hostnames, management addresses, and pinned host keys. The user interface displays device hostnames and supports a device-specific removal or an explicitly confirmed removal across all matching devices.

**Validation:** `python3 -m compileall -q src tests`; `python3 -m pytest -q` (7 passed); `python3 -m ruff check .`; `git diff --check`; Compose configuration rendered with temporary non-secret local configuration.

**Known limitations:** No privileged Rust FTD SSH agent, polling, FTD output parsing, real reconciliation, external log shipping, metrics, or live FTD/LDAP(S) integration exists yet. Production write operations intentionally fail closed until the agent is implemented and returns a verified response.

## 2026-10-13 — Privileged removal agent

**Status:** In progress; laboratory validation required

Added the Rust `ftd-shun-agent` and deployed it as the sole component with a route to FTD management. It listens on a private `AF_UNIX/SOCK_SEQPACKET` socket, checks the API peer UID, rejects unknown/malformed RPC requests, and exposes only the typed `REMOVE_SHUN` operation. For each removal it pins the server host key, uses the configured public-key identity, reads the target `show shun <IPv4>` state, permits only configured interface names, issues `no shun <IPv4> interface <name>`, then reads the target state again before returning success. The Compose stack now supplies the credential as a protected runtime secret and gives the agent no persistent writable volume.

**Validation:** `cargo build --release --locked --manifest-path agent/Cargo.toml`; `cargo test --locked --manifest-path agent/Cargo.toml` (4 passed); `python3 -m compileall -q src tests`; `python3 -m pytest -q` (11 passed); `python3 -m ruff check .`; `docker compose --env-file .env -f deploy/compose.yml config` with temporary non-secret configuration; `docker build -f agent/Dockerfile -t ftd-shun-agent:local-verify .` (image runs as UID/GID `10002:10001`); `git diff --check`.

**Known limitations:** The agent does not yet provide list/read responses, polling, reconciliation, structured external logging, or metrics. It has not yet been tested against an FTD lab; both CLI behavior and parser fixtures must be verified there before enabling production writes.

## 2026-10-13 — V1 simplicity decision and agent hardening

**Status:** In progress; laboratory validation required

Recorded the v1 decision to use one fleet-wide FTD service account/key inside the isolated agent. Reader/writer account separation and a one-time credential bootstrap remain deferred hardening options rather than release prerequisites. V1 removal uses a short-lived SSH connection per request; no persistent reader connection exists until polling is implemented and validated. Replaced the agent's private generic command-string execution primitive with a private `CiscoOperation` enum, so only source-defined typed operations can reach SSH. Marked the server-rendered CSRF cookie `HttpOnly`; the token remains available in the rendered form and is compared server-side.

**Validation:** `python3 -m compileall -q src tests`; `python3 -m pytest -q` (11 passed); `python3 -m ruff check .`; `cargo test --locked --manifest-path agent/Cargo.toml` (4 passed).

**Known limitations:** Docker Compose alone does not provide the required FTD egress ACL. Deployment still requires an environment-specific host/network policy and matching FTD SSH source restriction.

## 2026-10-13 — Polling and interactive-refresh policy

**Status:** Design recorded; implementation pending

Set the future baseline `show shun` polling default to five minutes and made it configurable. Authenticated UI state views may request a background refresh, but UI/API traffic must never open SSH directly or wait for Cisco output. The synchronizer will accept at most one interactive refresh sweep per 60 seconds globally and will enforce the same minimum interval per device. Interactive refreshes are considered only while there is Web/BFF activity. The UI will show last-successful refresh, a baseline countdown, and whether a refresh is idle, queued, or rate-limited.

**Validation:** Documentation-only design update; implementation is intentionally deferred until typed list/read agent responses and FTD parser fixtures exist.

**Known limitations:** The current agent rejects read operations and no synchronizer or freshness UI exists yet.

## 2026-10-13 — FTD lab-validation milestone

**Status:** Ready for operator input

Added a structured laboratory procedure for validating the current removal agent, collecting sanitized `show shun` parser fixtures, and recording fail-closed outcomes. This is the required gate before adding typed list/read RPC, polling, reconciliation, or the freshness UI.

**Validation:** Documentation-only update; `git diff --check` must pass with the associated change.

**Known limitations:** The next step requires a controlled FTD lab, approved network/source restrictions, and sanitized CLI output supplied by an operator.
